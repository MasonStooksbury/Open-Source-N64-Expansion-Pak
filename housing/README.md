# Custom, 3D-printable Housing

I've provided 3MF and STEP files for the housing so that it should work with any program and also be editable (should you want to modify it). I'll be the first to admit this may not be the best or most efficient design, but I wanted it to be relatively simple, rugged, mechanically stable, allow me to easily change it for upcoming projects, and not require supports when printing.

1) The design has a 25x25mm cutout to fit a heatsink. The one I have in the picture is 5mm tall, but you could easily fit a 7mm one (maybe an 8mm, but I haven't tested it. Just doing some measurements). At the time of writing, you can purchase these on Amazon [here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HLY7BKR?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) (not an affiliate link)

1) When printing, you'll want to flip the top section so that the inside is facing upwards. This design also does not require supports when printing. I did sand the inside of mine a little for a tighter fit, but this shouldn't be necessary depending on your printer and settings

1) The design is meant to be used with two M2 screws to hold everything together, but you can modify the hole if needed. I designed this to not use threaded inserts (as a lot of people do not have them), but if you would like to use those, I made the geometry of the holes very simple so that you could modify them to use inserts or some other solution. `NOTE: If you modify the holes in the top of the shell, be sure to fillet the end like I have so that you won't need to use supports`

1) Finally, I left the back face blank instead of putting some annoying logo or something. This way you can design the housing however you like!
